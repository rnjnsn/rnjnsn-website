            <p>A common block on the road towards a functioning knowledge-sharing practice is silos. [1] The project I was working on at the time was part of a brand with a long history and a future carved out for it. However, the knowledge generated on the various projects had siloed and was difficult to find and thus learn from for new projects for example. Moreover, two of the projects were sharing technology and for these it was crucial that a solution that be found that would make it easy for one to stay up-to-date with what was happening on the other. For this reason breaking down silos was a strategic focus point with high priority. More concretely, projects were separated out over different Confluence spaces so the task was to bind these spaces closer together</p>
        <h2>A Brand Landing Page</h2>
        <p>Breaking </p>
        <h2>A topbar</h2>
    <p>I designed and implemented a topbar to sit just below the standard Confluence topbar. Moreover, the user always knows which space they are on because they button that belongs to the current space is highlighted with its brand color using the :active pseudo-class. </p>
