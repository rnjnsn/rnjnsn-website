I personally can't stand that everything needs to be so friendly, so smooth, so soft. 

Byung Chul Hahn defines *Das Glatte* as the "signature of the present" (Signature des Gegenwarts). 

Clearly, if this is something that characterizes our culture in general, we should expect to see manifestations of it on our computers and on the web as well - and lo' and behold ... once you see it you cannot not see it. It is here, there and everywhere.



Friendly design.
